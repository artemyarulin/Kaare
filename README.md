Reactive cross platform event bus between native and JavaScript code

Wouldn't it be cool to build UI using ReactiveCocoa and use JavaScript as a cross platform business logic core which will utilize RxJS to solve callback hell? 

Kaare makes it even more awesome by making communication between native and JS code reactive as well.
